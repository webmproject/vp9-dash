Draft: VP Codec ISO Media File Format Binding
=============================================

_Kilroy Hughes and David Ronca, 2015.12.03_


Introduction
------------

This document specifies a general ISO Base Media track and sample format for
video encoded with Video Partition structured video codecs ("VP"), such as
MPEG VCB (MPEG-4 Part 31), VP8, VP9, etc.

VP Codec Sample Entry Box
-------------------------

This section describes the sample entry and sample format for VP elementary
streams.


### Definition

|           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------
| Box Type  | 'vp_xx_' where 'xx' is one of '08', '09' or '10'
| Container | Sample Description Box ('stsd')
| Mandatory | Yes, for VP codec tracks
| Quantity  | Exactly one

The 'vpxx' Sample Entry Box specifies the coding of Video Partition Codec
samples, and contains a 'vpcC' box that contains decoding and display
configuration information. 'vpxx' indicates the generic class used to
generate a box instance identified by the 4CC of the specific codec used.
The 4CC codes currently defined by this spec are 'vp08', 'vp09', 'vp10'.


### Syntax

~~~~~
class VP8SampleEntry extends VisualSampleEntry('vp08') {
    VPCodecConfigurationBox    config;
}

class VP9SampleEntry extends VisualSampleEntry('vp09') {
    VPCodecConfigurationBox    config;
}

class VP10SampleEntry extends VisualSampleEntry('vp10') {
    VPCodecConfigurationBox    config;
}
~~~~~


### Semantics

**compressorname** is a name, for informative purposes. It is formatted in a
fixed 32-byte field, with the first byte set to the number of bytes to be
displayed, followed by that number of bytes of displayable data, and then
padding to complete 32 bytes total (including the size byte). The field may
be set to 0.  The value "\012VPC Coding" is recommended; the first byte is a
count of the remaining bytes, here represented by \012, which (being octal
12) is 10 (decimal), the number of bytes in the rest of the string

**config** is defined in the following section.


VP Codec Configuration Box
--------------------------


### Definition

|           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------
| Box Type  | 'vpcC'
| Container | VP Codec Sample Entry Box ('vpxx')
| Mandatory | Yes
| Quantity  | Exactly One


### Description

The VP Codec Configuration Box is contained in every VP Codec Sample Entry
Box. It exposes the general video parameters in standard fields, useful for
track selection and display; and it contains decoder initialization
information specific to the codec and sample format indicated by the 4CC code
of the sample entry box that contains it. All parameters must be valid for
every sample that references the sample entry, and equal the parameter value
unless otherwise noted.


### Syntax

~~~~~
class VPCodecConfigurationBox extends FullBox('vpcC', version, 0){
      VPCodecConfigurationRecord() vpcConfig;
}

aligned (8) class VPCodecConfigurationRecord {

    unsigned int (8)     profile;
    unsigned int (8)     level;
    unsigned int (4)     bitDepth;
    unsigned int (8)     matrixCoefficients;
    unsigned int (3)     chromaSubsampling;
    unsigned int (8)     transferCharacteristics;
    unsigned int (1)     videoFullRangeFlag;
    unsigned int (16)    codecIntializationDataSize;
    unsigned int (8)[]   codecIntializationData;
`
}
~~~~~

### Semantics

**profile** is an integer that specifies the VP codec profile. The value of
profile must be valid for all samples that reference this sample entry, i.e.
profile SHALL be equal or greater than the profile used to encode the sample.

**level** is an integer that specifies a VP codec level all samples conform
to. The value is 0 if a codec level is not specified.

**bitDepth** is an integer that specifies the bit depth of the luma and color
components. Valid values are 8, 10, 12.

**matrixCoefficients** is an integer that is defined by the "Matrix coefficients"
section of ISO/IEC 23001-8:2016.

**chromaSubsampling** is an integer that specifies the chroma subsampling.
Only the values in the following table are specified. If matrixCoefficients is 0
(RGB), then chroma subsampling must be 3 (4:4:4).


| Value | Subsampling
|:-----:|:--------------------------------:
| 0     | 4:2:0 vertical
| 1     | 4:2:0 collocated with luma (0,0)
| 2     | 4:2:2
| 3     | 4:4:4
| 4..7  | Reserved

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1: 4:2:0 Subsampling with vertical chroma samples</p>

<img alt="Figure #2" src="images/image01.png" style="margin: 3em auto 1em auto; display: block;">
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 2: 4:2:0 chroma subsampling collocated with (0,0) luma</p>


**transferCharacteristics** is an integer that is defined by the "Transfer characteristics"
section of ISO/IEC 23001-8:2016.

**videoFullRangeFlag** indicates the black level and range of the luma and
chroma signals. 0 = legal range (e.g. 16-235 for 8 bit sample depth) 1 = full
 range (e.g. 0-255 for 8 bit sample depth).

**codecIntializationDataSize** For VP8 and VP9 this field must be 0.

**codecIntializationData** binary codec initialization data.  Not used for VP8 and VP9.


Video Samples
-------------

Video sample storage in the generic binding uses a simple mapping to frames
defined in the codec specification. The height and width in the Visual Sample
Entry are specified in square pixels. If the video pixels are not square, then
a 'pasp' box must be included.  ALTREF frames must be part of a superframe
structure.

Note: VP8 does not support superframes, and so it is not possible to carry VP8
using this specification if the VP8 stream includes ALTREF frames.

Common Encryption
-----------------

### Scheme Info Box (sinf)

If the VP9 data is encrypted, the Protection Scheme Info box ('sinf') shall be
present, and shall contain a Scheme Type ('schm') box. The scheme\_type field
of the 'schm' box shall be 'cenc', indicating that AES-CTR encryption is used
when samples are encrypted.


### Sample Encryption

VP8/9 samples packaged using this specification use sub-sample encryption as
specified in section 10.6 of "ISO/IEC 23001-7 Part 7: Common encryption in ISO
base media file format files". The subsample encryption table may be
implemented using the 'senc' box described in section 8.1 of "ISO/IEC 23001-7
Part 7" or the 'saio' and 'saiz' boxes described in section 8.7 of "14496-12".

When encrypting VP9 video frames, the uncompressed header must be unencrypted.
A subsample encryption (SENC) map must be used to identify the clear and
encrypted bytes of each video sample. This is illustrated in figure 1.

When encrypting superframes, the uncompressed headers of the displayed frame,
the uncompressed headers for all ALTREF frames, and the the superframe header
must be clear. The encrypted bytes of each frame within the superframe must be
block aligned so that the counter state can be computed for each frame within
the superframe. Block alignment is achieved by adjusting the size of the
unencrypted bytes that precede the encrypted bytes for that frame.

DASH Application
----------------

DASH and other applications require defined values for the "codecs" parameter
specified in RFC-6381 for ISO Media tracks. A Suggested codecs parameter of VP
codecs is:

~~~~~
<sample entry 4CC>.<profile>.<level>.<bitDepth>.<matrixCoefficients>.<chromaSubsampling>.<transferCharacteristics>.<videoFullRangeFlag>
~~~~~

Numbers are expressed in decimal. The string may be truncated on any parameter
in sequence following the sample entry, and missing values are indicated by a
sequence of two periods with no parameter value between them.

For example, `codecs="vp09.02.01.10.09.16.00"` to indicate 10 bit 4:2:0 Rec.
ITU-R BT.2020 non-constant luminance video encoded using VP9 profile 2 and level 1, 4:2:0 colocated
subsampling, st02-84 EOTF, and `codecs="vp09"` to indicate only the codec and
 sample format.
